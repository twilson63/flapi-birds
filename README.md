A template for creating javascript exercises with the ability to
run tests in the browser. Using testing tools like tape and tapBrowserColor we can generate high signal for students getting started with code. These high signal yet simple tools empower the student to focus on the problems they are trying to solve.

## How do I get started

* Clone the repo

First you need an idea, and a tool or technology you want your students to learn. Levels that progressively get harder seem to be something students like a lot.

Think of this tool not as the teaching instrument, but the practice tool, for students to get high return on their investment of your training.

### The Test Directory

The test directory is where you put your tests, you can take one of two approaches:

1.  you write the tests and have the students complete the exercises and validate against your tests.
2.  you can instruct the developers to create both the implementation and the tests.

> Both of these techniques are valuable.

## The src directory

This is where the student would implement their solution to the challenge.

When the student saves their work, the browser should automatically execute the test suite and return a solid signal of green if all the tests pass or red if one or more did not pass.

## Other things

* remember to modify the public/index.html page to customize your exercise
* remember to modify this readme with your instructions

## Contributing

* please submit an issue or pull request if you have ideas or implementation on how this tool can be improved

## Thank you!

Thank you for using this tool, it is simple, but can be a powerful light weight teaching mechanism for eager students.

Built with <3 for JavaScript from the JRS Coding School
