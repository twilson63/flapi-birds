# Flapi Birds

Flapi birds is a set of practice exercises for express nodejs rest api's.

All of the exercises are driven by tests, so all you need to do is open each file in your editor, and
then run `yarn start` in your console, the test will automatically run and validate
as you save your files.

## Learn objectives

To get familiar with the expressjs api and sending and receiving JSON data through REST endpoints.

## Challenges

There are four apis to build:

* birds
* dogs
* ducks
* zoo
* farm

With each api, you will need to implement the following endpoints:

* POST /
* GET /
* GET /:id
* PUT /:id
* DELETE /:id

All of the source files are in the routes directory.

* [ ] birds
* [ ] dogs
* [ ] ducks
* [ ] zoo
* [ ] farm

## What do I need to know?

* JavaScript
* NodeJS (modules)
* ExpressJS

## Requirements

* NodeJS v8+ https://nodejs.org
* Text Editor - https://atom.io

## How to play

* clone the `flapi-bird` repository
* cd into the directory `flapi-bird`
* run `npm install`
* open the project in your editor `atom .` || `code .`
* run `npm start`

The tests will be running in the console and will try to re-run every-time you save your files.

Open the `routes/birds.js` file in the routes folder and start to implement your api until all the tests are passing.

Repeat for all other api's.
